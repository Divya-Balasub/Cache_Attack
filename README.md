# Cache_Attack

This project is done for Side Channel Attack and Defenses 2020 - Saarland University

The Cache Attack is performed to retrieve the key used in AES encryption. Once the key is retrieved, we can hack the secret message by decrypting with the key.
The concept of cache hit and miss is used to do cache attack.

This attack is performed in Ubuntu machine.
The cache attack (provided in framework.c) is only done by me without altering the concept of AES encryption.
